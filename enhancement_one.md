# Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design

I rewrote the code from C++ into Java and created separate classes for a more modular design. Successfully transferring the code between these two languages showcased my ability to first understand the logic of how the code works as well as my understanding of the syntax between the two languages to achieve parity between the original artifact and the enhancement. Creating separate classes showcases my understanding and implementing best practices for Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

<table>
<tr>
<th>C++</th>
<th>Java</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
```cpp
<pre>

{
  
}														      
```
```
</pre>
</td>
<td>

```java
{
  "id": 5,
  "username": "mary",
  "email": "mary@example.com",
  "order_id": "f7177da"
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

```cpp

 ```


Through these enhancements, I have met the course objectives that I planned to meet in Module One which I have listed below:  

  
- Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
- Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
  
I really enjoyed making these initial enhancements, and it went a lot smoother than I anticipated. I had to brush up on Java again, since many of my past courses used C++. One of the main challenges I faced was understanding how input worked in Java versus C++ using the Scanner class.
