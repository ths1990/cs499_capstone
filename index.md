# CS499 Capstone

## Introduction

My name is Ty Simpson. I'm currently a process manager looking to make a career change into Software Engineering. I enjoy building tools to solve complex problems. I began my education in the early days of the pandemic. I've been learning virtually most of my academic career, which has made me more self-sufficent and resourceful. 

## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my two years at Southern New Hampshire University (and four years pursuing a Computer Science degree) I have developed and strengthened many skills that will set me up for sucess in pursuing a career as a software engineer. I have learned strategies for communicating and collaboring with a set audience, whether it be a team or a stakeholder. I know how to work with data strucutres and algorithms to build efficient code. I have developed best practices in software engineering across multiple programming languages and software security. I now have experience in working with multiple databases. 

### Collaborating and Communicating:

Before enrolling in SNHU, I had received my associate's degree at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College in Software Development. Much like SNHU, I had to complete a Capstone course in order to receive my degree. The project for that course was building a full stack C# web application with a team of my peers. The requirements for this application came straight from one of the head faculty members. Throughout this project, we implemented Agile principles through user stories and boards, regular stand ups, code reviews, and regular feedback. I served as the team lead and would regularly check in with the professor and the stakeholder to ensure our project was hitting the mark and get help in removing any barriers for my team. Once the project was complete, we got to present in front of our class, potential employers, and a couple of State senators. 

### Data Structures and Algorithms

In CS-300, Data Strucutres and Algorithms, I became familiar with the various complex data strucures and algorithms commonly used in software development. While many programming languages include built-in libraries to handle common data structures, I learned how to build them from scratch in C++ - things like linked lists, trees and hash maps and various search and sort algorithms. Doing so gave me a better understanding and appreciation for how they work and the pros and cons for each when it comes to code efficiency and memory management.

### Software Engineering and Security Best Practices

#### Software Engineering

Every course in this class has reinforced best practices for software engineering. While various languages have different rules and syntax, many of the best practices remain the same. It's important to use descriptive naming conventions when creating variables and methods. Variable names should describe what the variable represents. For instance, if you are writing a program that sells different types of candy you would want to use a variable to represent the various types of candy offered. 

The table below provides both an example of a good and bad variable name:

| Good  | Bad |
| ----  | --- |
| candy | cdy |

Using clear names for variables and methods as well as commenting helps make the code easier to understand and read.

In most cases, it is important to follow Object-Oriented Programming principles by utilizing classes to encapsulate and abstract data from the main execution. Doing so protects unauthorized access to the data as well as makes the code more flexible and re-usable. 

Lastly, I learned effective methods to automate software testing and QA. In CS-320, I learned how to build and run JUnit tests to ensure code runs as intended, even when the unintended happens. 

#### Security

In CS-305, Software Securiyt, I learned the importance of vulnerability scans and using what I uncovered through those scans to determine how to close existing vulnerabilies in the code I worked with. Vulnerability reports come with a lot of important information, like root cause of an issue and even suggested actions to address to the vulnerability. 

In CS-405, Secure Coding, I developed best practices to address common security flaws found in code. I learned how to address buffer overflow, numeric overflow, and SQL Injection. I also learned about Defense-In-Depth strategies and developing a DevSecOps framework to incorporate security throughout the software development lifecycle. My final project for that course was a presentation on impelementing secure coding standards and security polices - like authentication, authorization and least-privelege policies, and system monitoring.  

#### Databases

In my associates program, I spent a lot of time with SQL and T-SQL. I learned how to create Entity-Relationship Diagrams and build a database from the ground up using Microsoft SQL Server. In the Capstone I talked about earlier, the Database layer of the application was built on SQL.

During my time at SNHU, I primarily worked with MongoDB, a noSQL database. I found Mongo easier to work with - though making entity relationships were a little more complex with Mongo than with SQL. In CS-340, Client/Server Development, I learned how to interact with mongosh in the Linux command line interface. While in the Capstone, I set up my own cluster, database, and collection in the web interface.

### Artifact Introduction

I will be working on enhancing a single artifact across the three different enhancement categories. In CS-410, Software Reverse Engineering, I was tasked with the converting an assembly file into executable C++ code and then making improvements to the code to make it more secure. While working on the project, I had plenty of ideas how to make it better beyond the scope of the class. Fortunately, this course came right after so the code and my ideas were still fresh in my mind. 

The artifact was a single C++ file, and lacked modular classes, data structures, and no persistent data storage. Data that would be deemed sensitive was hard coded and could easily be accessed by bad actors. There was a lot of room for improvement. 

In the Software Engineering enhancement, I re-wrote the code in Java and created modular classes.
In the Data Structure and Algorithms, I implemented a Map structure and an efficient search algorithm to locate clients to make changes. 
In the Database enhancement, I set up my own cluster, database, and collection in the web interface and connected the database to my Java application.
